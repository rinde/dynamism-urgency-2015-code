For the final version of the paper this webpage and repository will be archived using [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/). Consequently, all code and data of the experiments will be accessible via a [DOI](http://www.doi.org/)  ensuring the availability of all resources for the future.

## Overview
Since the paper is part of a long term research effort, the code used for the experiments is distributed over several repositories. The code in the current repository is the glue that instantiates and binds the code from the other repositories to create a cohesive experiment setup.

### Main experiment


The code of the main experiment sits in the following files:
 + Code that generates the scenarios used in the experiments: [generator](src/main/java/com/github/rinde/dynurg/Generator.java)
 + The scenarios that were generated can be found here __add link__
 + Code for performing the experiment: [experiment](src/main/java/com/github/rinde/dynurg/Experimentation.java)
 + The raw results of the experiments can be found here __add link__


### Dynamism generation experiment
This is the experiment to find with what parameters and methods certain dynamism levels can be obtained.
 + Code for performing the experiment can be found [here]([experiment](src/main/java/com/github/rinde/dynurg/Experimentation.java))

### Dependencies
 + The optimization algorithms used in the experiment are in a different project: [RinLog](http://github.com/rinde/RinLog) version 1.0.0. 
 + Most of the code for generating scenarios is part of [RinSim](http://github.com/rinde/RinSim) version 3.0.0.

## How to run
